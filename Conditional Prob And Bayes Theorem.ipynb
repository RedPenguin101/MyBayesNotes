    "Conditional probability is about determining the probability of an event $A$ *conditioned on* a piece of information $B$. This is denoteed $P(A \\mid B)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What 'conditioned on' means can vary a bit. It's simplest application it for looking at results of experimental data divided into subsets; it can be used to find probabilities of events within that subset. For example 'what is the probability that a randomly selected student is female, given that they are a Comp Sci student'. This is equivalent to $P(F \\mid CS)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, and in general, we can use the foundational property of conditional probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A\\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\n",

    "The denominator there, $P(B)$, might benefit from unpacking a bit. In the mini example above, this would be the probability that a random student of any gender is a Comp Sci student.\n",

    "If the numerator is the *conditioned* probability of $B$, in general you could say that the denominator is the *unconditioned* probability of $B$, assessing $P(B \\mid A)P(A)$ over every possible value of $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you have a bunch of possible outcomes of $B$, where the outcome depends on information/event $A$, the probability of event $A$ conditioned on $B$ is equal to the probability of $B$ given $A$, divided by the probablity of $B$ across all possible values of $A$.\n",

    "We saw above how you can apply conditional probability across subsets of experimental data. A different use would be to make assessments about the underlying distribution of a variable where you have or will have experimental data and want to infer from that the statistical parameters of the distribution. This is Statistical Inference in the Bayesian Paradigm, or **Bayesian Inference**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea here is that you are testing a random variable $X$ and are going to perform some experiments to get results of $X$. You can guess that $X$ is approximated by some type of distribution, but you want to know the statistical parameters, $\\theta$ of that distribution. You also have a **Prior**, or a intial guess of what those parameters could take, and what the probability function, $f(\\theta)$ is, before actually conducting the experiment. The idea of Bayesian Inference is to use Bayes' Theorum to come to a **posterior** result, or a new, better guess of $\\theta$ after you have conducted your experiment and got result $x$.\n",
