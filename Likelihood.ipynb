    "Likelihood (or the Likelihood Function) is a concept in frequentist statistical inference which describes the plausibility of a distribution model parameter value given observations you've made. So like 'what is the likely value $p$ for a Binomial distributed variable given experiments you have run'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrast this with the meaning of *probability*, which is the plausibility of a random outcome, given a model parameter, like 'what is the probability of an outcome $x$ given $X \\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)$.\n",

    "To find the likelyhood you need to 'flip' the PDF, expressing it as a function of $\\theta$ in terms of $x$, rather than the other way around. "
